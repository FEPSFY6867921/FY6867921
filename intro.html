  <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
  </p>

<p>
  Around the world, company investments in Machine Learning have increased significantly, and “91% of top businesses have reported having ongoing investments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning” <b><i>(O’Donnellan, 2024)</i></b>. 
</p>
<p>
  Machine Learning and Cybersecurity are vital in the modern-day, and with new methods to defend against cybercriminals, it has become increasingly important to understand these methods. This is why I have chosen to investigate the effectiveness of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity and find out how it is used to defend against Data Mining.

  In this research project, there are 3 sections, which will cover various topics:

  <dt><b>Machine Learning:</b></dt>
  <p></p>
  <dd>-	What is it?</dd>
  <dd>-	What are the typical uses?</dd>
  <p></p>
  <dt><b>Cybersecurity:</b></dt>
  <p></p>
  <dd>-	What is it and why is it important?</dd>
  <dd>-	What is the link between Cybersecurity and Machine Learning?</dd>
  <p></p>
  <dt><b>Data Mining:</b></dt>
