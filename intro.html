  <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
  </p>

<p>
  Around the world, company investments in Machine Learning have increased significantly, and “91% of top businesses have reported having ongoing investments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning” <i><b>(O’Donnellan, 2024)</b></i>. Although Machine Learning is so widely recognised, few people fully understand its true capabilities. Data Mining, however, is not as commonly known, and even fewer know of the dangers it presents to organisations globally. 
</p>

<p>
  Cybersecurity is vital in the modern-day, and with new methods to defend against cybercriminals, it has become increasingly important to understand these methods. This is why I have chosen to investigate the effectiveness of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity and find out how it is used to defend against Data Mining.
