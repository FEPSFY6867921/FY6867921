  <h2><u>What is Data Mining?</u></h2>
  </p>

  <p>
    Data Mining is a process by which data is analysed for patterns and links within large data sets. It is most used in business, scientific research and criminal detection, and by combining methods from statistics and ML, it has improved significantly since its creation in the 1980s <i><b>(Clifton, 2024)</b></i>.  It is a very “versatile tool” <i><b>(Holdsworth, 2024)</b></i>, as it can analyse any type of data to find patterns, therefore meaning that any department of an organisation would benefit from using Data Mining for their data processing.
  </p>

<p>
  It is an ever-evolving technology which organisations globally have begun using for fraud detection and identifying security breaches. By using ML to identify these threats, the algorithms can learn and identify potentially hazardous data. This is vital to keeping businesses and their data safe from any hackers; however, it also has its downsides. <i><b>(Holdsworth, 2024)</b></i>
</p>

<p>
  <h2><u>Why does Data Mining pose a threat to Cybersecurity?</u></h2>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although Data Mining is incredibly useful to the government and other organisations, it is also useful to cybercriminals and hackers. When hackers are searching for certain information, they will use Data Mining to scan an entire network automatically, which will pinpoint where the desired data can be found. This saves a lot of time for the hackers, resulting in organisations being frequently attacked and more data being lost. <i><b>(Smith, 2009)</b></i>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h2><u>How does Machine Learning defend against Data Mining?</u></h2>
    </p>

<p>
  In an ideal world, ML and Data Mining would be used with the same intentions, and ML would not have to defend against Data Mining. However, with cybercriminals gaining access to Data Mining technologies, ML has been forced to defend companies from Data Mining. Since ML and Data Mining are “complementary in nature”, it allows for ML to “develop highly predictive models” <i><b>(Shams, 2023)</b></i>, which can be used for analysing data patterns and, identifying possible targets for cybercriminals and improving security measures for those suspected targets.
