  <h2><u>What is Data Mining?</u></h2>
  </p>

  <p>
    Data Mining is a process by which data is analysed for patterns and links within large data sets. It is mostly used in business, scientific research and criminal detection, and by combining methods from statistics and ML, it has improved significantly since its creation in the 1980s <i><b>(Clifton, 2024)</b></i>.  Data Mining is a very “versatile tool” <i><b>(Holdsworth, 2024)</b></i>, as analysis can be run on many types of data to find patterns. This can prove to be beneficial in many parts of a business, ranging from Marketing and Finance to Sales and IT.
  </p>

<p>
  It is an ever-evolving technology which organisations globally have begun using for fraud detection and identifying security breaches. By using ML to identify these threats, the algorithms can learn and identify potential issues within the data. This is vital to keeping businesses and their data safe from hackers; however, it also has its downsides. <i><b>(Holdsworth, 2024)</b></i>

  <h2><u>Why does Data Mining pose a threat to Cybersecurity?</u></h2>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Although Data Mining is incredibly useful to the government and other organisations, it is also useful to cybercriminals and hackers. When hackers are searching for certain information, they will use Data Mining to scan an entire networks automatically, pinpointing where the desired data can be found. This saves time for the hackers, resulting in organisations needing to defend themselves from frequent attacks and data breaches. <i><b>(Smith, 2009)</b></i>
  </p>

    <h2><u>How does Machine Learning defend against Data Mining?</u></h2>
    </p>

<p>
  In an ideal world, ML and Data Mining would be used with the same intentions, and not be used for nefarious purposes. However, with cybercriminals gaining access to Data Mining technologies, companies have been forced to use Machine Learning algorithms to help defend against these attacks. Since ML and Data Mining are “complementary in nature”, it allows for “development of highly predictive models” <i><b>(Shams, 2023)</b></i>, used for analysing data patterns and, identifying possible targets for cybercriminals and improving security measures.
