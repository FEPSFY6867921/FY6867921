  <h2><u>What is Cybersecurity and why is it important?</u></h2>
  </p>

<p>
  Cybersecurity is the process of lowering the risk of cyber-attacks and defending against any potential attacks through methods such as firewalls and intrusion monitoring. Technology is used in almost every aspect of modern-day life, and it becomes increasingly challenging to function without it. “From online banking to social media”, technology is used all the time, the importance of keeping all your data safe increases day by day. It is vital for preventing any cyber-criminals from getting hold of your data and avoiding unwanted stress. <i><b>(NCSC, 2016)</b></i>

  <h2><u>What is the link between Cybersecurity and Machine Learning?</u></h2>
  </p>

  <p>
    Cybersecurity is arguably the most important use of ML in that it “identifies and responds to security incidents, using threat detection algorithms” (IBM, 2024). Some companies, such as Cisco, use ML to analyse data for potential patterns that would be caused by the presence of malware (Cisco, 2023). Browsers such as Google and Bing also use ML to identify potentially hazardous websites and avoid recommending them to ensure safe searching <i><b>(Law, 2024)</b></i>.
