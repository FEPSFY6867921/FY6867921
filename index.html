    <p>
      For the conference project, I have investigated the effectiveness of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity and how it is used to defend against Data Mining. Many people are very familiar with the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but may not have realised that Machine Learning is an application of AI. Machine Learning is not as commonly known and could lead to misconceptions about Machine Learning and AI.
