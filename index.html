    <p>
      For the conference project, I have investigated the effectiveness of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity and how it is used to defend against Data Mining. The idea that Machine Learning can be used to defend against Data Mining may seem counter-intuitive initially, due to Machine Learning relying on Data Mining to become more efficient, but you will find out why.
