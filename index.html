      Globally, company investments have skyrocketed such that “91% of top businesses have ongoing investments” <i><b>(O’Donnellan, 2024)</b></i> in AI and Machine Learning (ML). Despite its prevalence in modern-day society, few understand its true capabilities, which is why I have investigated the effectiveness of ML in Cybersecurity and how it is used to defend against Data Mining. ML is a subset of AI and is an algorithm that reflects how humans learn <i><b>(Hosch, 2024)</b></i> by problem identification, error identification and optimisation <i><b>(Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024)</b></i>. ML has many different uses, the most common being in Cybersecurity, which is the process of defending against cyber-attacks through ML using threat detection algorithms to respond to security incidents” <i><b>(IBM, 2024)</b></i>. Data Mining is a set of algorithms that analyse data for patterns and links. Organisations are at risk of cybercriminals using Data Mining to quickly search for data to steal <i><b>(Smith, 2009)</b></i>, where ML uses “highly predictive models” <i><b>(Shams, 2023)</b></i> to identify targets and protect them accordingly.
