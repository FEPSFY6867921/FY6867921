  <h2><u>What is Machine Learning?</u></h2>
  </p>

  <p>
  Machine learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that consists of algorithms that reflect how humans learn, hence granting this learning capability to technology. Initially, when these programs are written, they are very inaccurate and have many faults, but over a prolonged period of time, the accuracy of the technology improves.

    <li>Decision</li>
    <li>Error</li>
    <li>Optimisation</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    All ML source code will follow these 3 sections because for the technology to learn and adapt, it must be able to identify the error made and adjust and find an alternative solution to the problem. By repeating this process, the technology becomes faster and more effective over time, becoming an invaluable tool for businesses. <i><b>(Stryker & Kavlakoglu, 2024)</b></i>

    <h2><u>What are the typical uses for Machine Learning?</u></h2>
    </p>  
    
    <p>
      Machine Learning has many uses in modern-day technology, some more commonly known than others. A primary example is the ever-improving biometric systems. Many Apple and Android devices use biometric scanners, such as Touch ID and Face ID, which were added to Apple Devices towards the end of 2017. <i><b>(Cipriani, 2020)</b></i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Biometric systems use ML to observe patterns within the biometric scan. When Touch ID is initially set up on devices, the biometric system scans for unique patterns in the fingerprint and uses algorithms to register only as correct when that specific pattern is detected. <i><b>(Reddy et al., 2023)</b></i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Another common example is product recommendations on retail websites, such as Amazon and social media platforms. It uses ML to observe the usersâ€™ purchases, clicks and search history. The algorithm then filters the information to recommend products based on what it has observed about the user. Many different algorithms are used for this, but Collaborative Filtering is the most common choice. <i><b>(NVIDIA, 2021)</b></i>
